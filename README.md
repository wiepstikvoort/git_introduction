# git_introduction

Welcome to the repository of the Git workshop for the DECO LIBRARY!
If we've made it this far, then now is the moment we'll start a little collaboration game. </br>

## MAKE IT WORK
### Introduction
The name of the game is 'Make it work'. Wiep is a bit lazy (known for showing up late and such..), and doesn't feel like putting the work together. So, instead Wiep wants to be able to just clone or pull this repo, and be able to run it in a local workspace. However, there's a mess of different files, and some bits and pieces that need to be added to the files. </br>
In the end, Wiep wants to be able to get some nice graphs based on timeseries which were (surprise surprise) yielded from a Hopf model. </br>

### Methods
So how do you go about this? Well, Octocat was so kind to write down the issues. Coding issues that is, not personal issues. You can find them in this repository, divide them amongst yourselves and solve them. </br>

More specifically:
- Create your own branch
- If the issue asks for it, fork 
- Upload whatever needs to be uploaded (some issues need other issues ot be solved beforehand)
- Create pull requests

All functions should be in one file, so that they can be loaded easily in one go.

### Lastly
You've received an email with different files which can be used for this collab. 
GOOD LUCK!
